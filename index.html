      Dear two year old self,
    </p>
           <p>
             Please try to sit still. Trust me I know what happens when you roll around in your sleep. I'd kinda like to keep all of my bones intact. I am offically surprised how you managed to sleep through breaking a bone. At first dad thought that the lamp fell over but of course it just had to be a human child. Just so you know your future self cannot lift there left arm up as high as the right one. Thank you for that by the way.

        Dear four year old self,
      </p>
          <p>
             When you are getting stung by 23 bees mybe instead of standing there screaming you should run. Also please remember that you drank the slushie. It will make this situation easier for everybody.

        Dear eight year old self,
      </P>
           <p>
             You are going to go on a ride with dad. On said ride you are going to go down a hill and instead of turning and staying safe you are going to go straight into the road. While all of this is happening you will fall off your bike and your helmet will come off. No fear you will be fine, but this will emotionally scar you and probably your mother.

         Dear other past selves,
       </P>
           <p>
             Thank you for not being to self distructive or weird that I thought I had to adress you personally from the future. I commend you.

      Dear three year old self,
    </P>
          <p>
            Have you ever seen a human person? They do not look like spiders with human faces. Seriously I really think you scared mom and dad with that stuff. I'm surprised that dad even kept them. Also I know you want the sun to be cool and fun (trust me I know that you always added sunglasses), but the sun is actually 5,778 K hot. What was that song you wrote? you must know the one I'm talking about. Remember the "I don't care I'm dying" song?  Well... though you aren't technacally wrong, but I would suqqest something happier like Rose's song. The one titled "Happy Days" it was happy, fun and didn't make people look at her weirdly.
          </P>

      Dear future self,
    </p>
          <p>
            Good luck in highschool. I've heard that art schools can be pretty competitve for solos and stuff like that. I wish you the best of luck with that. I know everything will be fine. If you need help, please ask for it. Asking is way easier then suffering through a subject alone. Remember the locus rule. When you succeed YOU did that, when you fail YOU did that and it is now time to look for a way to fix that. Do research when doing homework. Ask mom and dad for help. Ask your teachers for help. Stay calm throughout the year there is no need to stress. Try to be positive. Work on that stage fright and don't forget to study. I am  going to do some research on study habits and organization. I hope this pays off.
